excerpt: Small wording differences create hidden cognitive tax across complex products.

When labels drift between teams, users have to constantly translate meaning. That translation cost compounds across sessions.

## Symptoms
- Same action, multiple names.
- Same term, different outcomes.
- Ambiguous status labels in critical flows.

## Fixes
- Maintain a product language glossary.
- Review copy as part of design QA, not only content QA.
- Treat wording changes as behavior changes.

Consistency in copy is not branding polish. It is interaction reliability.

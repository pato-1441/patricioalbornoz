excerpt: How to use animation as product communication rather than decoration.
---
Motion should communicate a state change. If it does not communicate anything, it is visual debt.

A practical rule: animate ownership changes. When an element enters, exits, expands, or changes hierarchy, motion helps users track continuity.

## Build a small motion system
Teams often add micro-interactions before defining principles. That creates inconsistency and fatigue.

1. Define 2-3 transition durations and reuse them.
2. Define one easing curve for entrances and one for exits.
3. Map each animation to a clear product intent.

> Good motion disappears into the experience. Users remember responsiveness, not the animation itself.

excerpt: Empty states should teach users what to do next, not only explain what is missing.

An empty state is not a dead end. It is the first onboarding touchpoint for a feature.

Bad empty states only describe absence. Better ones communicate intent.

## The structure I use
- One sentence describing value.
- One action that starts progress.
- One optional secondary action for advanced users.

If the interface includes data-heavy screens, empty states are often the highest-leverage copy in the product.

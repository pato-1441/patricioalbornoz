Every interface promises behavior. Buttons, labels, and page structure become implicit contracts users rely on.

Contracts break when one team optimizes for speed while another optimizes for polish without shared acceptance criteria.

## Make contracts explicit
Define contract checks for response timing, irreversible actions, and persistence expectations.

### A practical review checklist

- Is the system state clearly visible after each transition?
- Are failure paths recoverable without support?

Predictable interfaces are not about minimalism. They are about trust, and trust lets users move quickly without hesitation.

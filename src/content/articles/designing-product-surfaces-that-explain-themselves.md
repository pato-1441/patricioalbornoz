excerpt: A practical system for reducing support load by making states, empty cases, and handoffs self-explanatory.

Most product friction does not come from feature gaps. It comes from unclear interfaces where users have to infer state, intent, or outcome.

A strong product surface explains itself at first glance: what is happening, what can happen next, and what will happen after an action.

## Start with naming
Labels should describe user outcomes, not internal implementation details. If engineering terms leak into UI, the burden shifts to the user.

## Design states as a narrative
Empty, loading, success, and failure states should feel like one continuous story instead of isolated fragments.

- Empty states should suggest a meaningful next action.
- Loading states should preserve context whenever possible.
- Error states should provide recovery options, not just blame.

When teams treat interface clarity as a system instead of a polish pass, complexity becomes manageable and support requests naturally decline.
